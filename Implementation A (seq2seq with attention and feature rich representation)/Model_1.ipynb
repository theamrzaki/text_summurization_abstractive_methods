And I think of the old Monty Python segment focusing on Spam. . . .<br /><br />It's not so easy for me to enjoy! Plain Spam, even cooked, doesn't do it for me.  I start out with good intentions of eating it as part of a meal and normally throw quite a bit of it out. So, this time around, I tried something different--a fried Spam sandwich.<br /><br />I cut up and fried some shallots, slathered a couple pieces of bread with Dijon mustard and catsup, and melted some American cheese over the Spam.  And it worked! This time, I successfully fixed something that didn't feature the Spam taste.  The result was an enjoyable sandwich.<br /><br />So, instead of throwing out all the Spam (as has happened in the past), I'm going to use my imagination this time in preparing this for a meal. In the past, this would have rated 1 to 2 stars; this time around, I'll give it three.\n",

Still, you are told not to steep green tea for more than a couple minutes or else the bitter flavor comes out.  So, with matcha it's just gonna happen, since you can't take out the tea bag.<br /><br />That said, the Japan matcha was more granular than a \"powder\", more like sand really, and did not produce much bitterness even after ten minutes in hot water.  This Taiwan tea by comparison is a true powder.  It is difficult to dissolve, clumping a quite a bit, and produces a flavor that within a few minutes in hot water becomes bitter, then later even more bitter.<br /><br />UPDATE: It turns out you use a lot less of it than you do of the Japanese matcha I had.  The powder, since it is so fine, goes much further.  To help you with this, they have a spoon in the box to right-size the servings.  I was using a much larger teaspoon instead previously.

One of my main recommendations for working with this dataset and model is either use a GPU, a subset of the dataset, or plenty of time to train your model. As you might be able to expect, the model will not be able to make good predictions just by seeing many reviews, it needs so see the reviews many times to be able to understand the relationship between words and between descriptions & summaries. \n",

After creating numerous reviews and checking those from the dataset, I can happily say that most of the generated summaries are appropriate, some of them are great, and some of them make mistakes. I'll try to improve this model and if it gets better, I'll update my GitHub.\n",
